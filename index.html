<p class="Information"> Welcome to Our Concrete World. This website showcases my course portfolio and project. The project demonstrates the benefits of urban density in the form of efficiency and innovation. Cities are some of the oldest and greatest human inventions. People have lived in Athens since 5000B.C and nowadays Tokoyo is home to 37 million people. It is a mistake to think that cities will not survive the Coronavirus Pandemic. Cities such as London and New York have survivied pandemics, wars, terrorism and natural disasters. The Our Concrete World project uses data to show its benefits. </p>
<p class="Information"> The motivation for this research comes from the fact that cities in developed countries are at a crossroads. The Covid-19 Pandemic forced businesses to close their offices and for workers to work from home (WFH). Subseqently, many workers that have been able to carry out their jobs remotely have preferred WFH or a hybrid version whererby they work some of the week in an office and the rest of the time at home. This revolution of working begs the question, what will happen to cities if people can work remotely. Businesses will require less office space, cafe's and restaurants will recieve lower footfall and workers will spend less time commutting. Workers may deicde to move out of cities and purchase larger properties in suburbs or commuter towns. Have cities reached a tipping point whereby their long run growth may start to decline?</p>
<p class="Information"> Although, the long-run trend has been ever greater urbanisation. By 2050 the UN predicts that over 70% of the World's population will live in cities. As countries get richer, rural to urban migration has increased, increasing urban populations. This trend has stood the test of time despite previous  wars, pandemics and natural disasters. As countries develop cities grow. </p>
<p class="Information"> This project uses data from a variety of sources including the OECD, Google Mobility reports and satalite data. All the charts were designed to be as automated as possible. The data is mainly retrieved from APIs and webscraping. Data cleaning and analysis was done in Python through Jupyter Notebook and in JS through Vegalite. My approach ensures that this is an automated dataflow so that any changes to the data is automatically seen in the charts.  </p>
