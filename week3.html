<!--HWK go back to visulisation try to change something about it. Try to load the datasets as an array. Take your spec and go to vegaeditor.
Change something in the data. Clone the visualisation. Go to the file and change it. Save the data to a csv file. Try to switch the source of the data from the remote to a local location. Put the data in your folder. Second method is to upload it to github and then use the full url.

Task 3: Go to the csv file. Take a few rows. Make a JS object out of the CSV. Do it manually. Take 5 to 10 rows. Once you have JSO instead of values comes [{},{},{},{}]-->
